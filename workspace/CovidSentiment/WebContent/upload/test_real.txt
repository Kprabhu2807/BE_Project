	Began the day with a rally in Arunachal Pradesh and the final rally was in Gondia in Maharashtra.

My travels across the country convince me that there is unprecedented affection for BJP. 

India wants Modi Sarkar yet again!

The undercurrent in West Bengal is fast turning into a wave. TMC has betrayed and looted Bengal. BJP will develop Bengal. @BJP4Bengal https://t.co/mrHwgirrXK
	There was record enthusiasm in the rally in Gondia, Maharashtra.

It is BJP-Shiv Sena-RPI(A) all the way in the state.

Next time you meet NCP leaders, do ask them- why are they so worried about a few people who have just been arrested? Do they fear the beans will be spilled? https://t.co/9gl6yBIsna
	Farmers suffered greatly during Congress rule. 

The party did not bother to increase MSP while there were long lines for urea.

Things have changed in the last 5 years. 

For a vibrant agriculture sector, vote BJP! https://t.co/QPC5mXO6pG
	I asked the people of Gondia:

Do they trust the NDA Government?

Are they happy with the direction the nation is taking?

This is what they said.. https://t.co/vdOEWHn7eW
	NDA’s development agenda moves at record pace.

Lots has been done for West Bengal but I want to work more.

Didi is playing the role of a speed-breaker, who is slowing down the state’s progress.

West Bengal does not need such speed-breakers. https://t.co/uAEgks05pa
	Our forces give a strong reply to forces of terror but the pain in Didi’s mind was as much as the pain among the perpetrators of terror. 

TMC's lackadaisical attitude towards national security has angered the people of West Bengal. https://t.co/8nmPUFYzvg
	These pictures from Siliguri will give sleepless nights to the TMC! The ground beneath their feet stands shaken, their support among people is falling by the day. 

Left, Congress and TMC have taken turns to ruin Bengal. BJP will stop this and provide the state a good government. https://t.co/edexuhnwPr

	Odisha is going to do what UP did in 2017 and Tripura in 2018! Odias want freedom from mining mafias, chit fund looters and those who deny good healthcare.
